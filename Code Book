Code BooK

This code book describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the 
information contained in the data Set "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0"

For each record it is provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The R script provided in this repository contains the necesary steps to:

    Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names.
    Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
